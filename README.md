# Parsifal

Parsifal is an OCaml-based parsing engine.

Parsifal is a collection of binary parsers and tools.


# Ongoing support

Parsifal has been originally developed at ANSSI, but new releases are
not provided by the agency anymore.

Therefore, anyone who wishes to get upstream versions of the project
must visit https://github.com/picty/parsifal as this page now
**only serves archive purposes**.

# Project archives

ANSSI is providing the last stable commited version of parsifal as an archive on this website:

  * [parsifal-0.3.tar.gz](releases/parsifal-0.3.tar.gz)
